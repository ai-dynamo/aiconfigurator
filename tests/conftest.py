Global pytest configuration and fixtures.

This file contains global fixtures and configurations shared across all test modules.
Module-specific fixtures are located in their respective conftest.py files:
- tests/sdk/database/conftest.py - Database-related fixtures
- tests/cli/conftest.py - CLI-related fixtures

# Global pytest configuration can go here
# For now, keeping it minimal since module-specific fixtures
# are in their dedicated conftest.py files
